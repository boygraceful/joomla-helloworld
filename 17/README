# This script is meant as a helpful tool in order to manage your extensions,
# package them and keep them up to date with your source code repositories

### Updating extensions from source tree
#
# The following commands are used to pull an extension out of the development
# tree defined by the source.dir property and into the repository
# "build" is also the default target, so the two commands are equivalent

phing -Dextension=com_helloworld
phing -Dextension=com_helloworld build

### Packaging extensions
#
# The following commands are used to produce installable packages, this is 
# performed by the dist target

phing -Dextension=com_helloworld dist

# In order to build an extension with a specific version number instead of the build
# time, the following can be used. The version parameter has no effect on the build
# target, only dist.

phing -Dextension=com_helloworld -Dversion=1.0 dist

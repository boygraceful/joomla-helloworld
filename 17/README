### Updating extensions from source tree
#
# The following commands are used to pull an extension out of the development
# tree defined by the source.dir property and into the repository
# "build" is also the default target, so the two commands are equivalent

phing -Dextension=com_helloworld
phing -Dextension=com_helloworld build

### Packaging extensions
#
# The following commands are used to produce installable packages, this is 
# performed by the dist target

phing -Dextension=com_helloworld dist
